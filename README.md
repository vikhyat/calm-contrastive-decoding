# Confident Adaptive Language Modeling ðŸ«¶ Contrastive Decoding

The [Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15097) paper describes a technique to product higher quality text from language models by using the difference between predictions from a large LM (called the expert, e.g. OPT-13B), and a small LM (called the amateur, e.g. OPT-125M). This repository contains the code for an experiment to see whether we can use early exit, as described in the [Confident Adaptive Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07061) paper, in lieu of the amateur model to reduce the computational cost of contrastive decoding.
